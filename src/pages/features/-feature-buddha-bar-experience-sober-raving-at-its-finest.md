We keep a close eye on Sydney’s underground electronic music scene here at Rave Reviewz and one thing we can say with confidence, is that sober raving is a force to be reckoned with. Whether it’s because people are sick of being hungover all weekend, the restrictions around alcohol with the Lockout laws or the rise of health consciousness, there is clearly an appetite for a cleaner alternative to enjoying dance music events in Sydney.

<br>

Nothing demonstrates this more than the story of BuddhaBar experience, who have an impressive record of selling out their last 17 events in a city where the nightlife economy is struggling. Now we’d expect open minded individuals to head down to a sober rave and give it a whirl, but 17 sold out events grabbed our attention - so we decided to investigate exactly what’s pulling in all the punters. 

<br>

The man behind BuddhaBar experience, Marc Tomkinson, told us what inspired him to take this left-field approach…“The concept actually evolved from hosting sober, conscious house parties. My vision was to create a healthy alternative to nightlife events based around connection to people, music, dance and wellness. I wanted people to experience beyond the average party and showcase how music can get us high naturally just from good vibes.”

So what has the reaction been like so far from actual attendees? “People love it! We get lots of amazing feedback from guests. They don't crave alcoholic drinks, get naturally high on good vibes and leave feeling revived from a unique night out.”

BuddhaBar experience is described as a ‘holistic nightclub experience’, and this Friday’s event definitely appears to fit that bill. Kicking off with some guided movement flow encompassing electronic music, movement and breath-work, followed by a session of Deep House Yoga, live African drumming and healthy doses of tribal and healing beats from DJs R.I.A and Alchemistress - it sounds like a feast for the senses.

In the absence of alcohol, there’s also an intriguing elixir bar with drinks made of cacao (which can protect the nerves and skin and benefits cognition and mood) and other good stuff. The combination of music, movement and healthy mood enhancing drinks sounds like a winning formula - one that all should try.  

<br>

So what’s next for the BuddhaBar experience you ask? Mark has (naturally) high hopes… “We want to bring more happiness, connection and consciousness to dance floors around Australia and the world. We're actually planning events in Melbourne & Queensland this summer… stay tuned!”

<br>

We certainly will. Check out the BuddhaBar experience this Friday at The Junction to feel enlightened. Tickets [here](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/buddhabar-experience-bass-alchemy-tickets-65767206485).
