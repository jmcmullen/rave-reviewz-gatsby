We love a good morning party here at Rave Reviewz, which is why we were stoked to hear that Morning Glory is back! Those who were at the inaugural event this past Mardi Gras will know it’s a mad dress-up carnival scored with delicious beats. The outfits ranged from the fun to the fantastical at the sensational post-Mardi Gras afterparty, and the vibe was electric with the likes of chart-topper Beth Yen on the decks:

So it seems fitting that following the success of their first outing, the boys behind the brand, Jacob West and James Whalley, have decided to bring it back for another round. So this long weekend at 5am on Sunday, the Home Terrace will come alive with sexy sounds, bright colours and outfits like this!

The line-up this time round boasts some of Sydney’s best disco & classic house selectors including local legend Rodd Richards, Sveta and one of our faves, L.O.U. Here’s a taste of her in action to get you excited:

Being the nosey sorts we are, we caught up with party-starter James to find out more... “Jacob and I are both day club veterans and leading into Mardi Gras it was the one thing we were missing, so we decided to go for it with the first Morning Glory event. The success of that first party and the lovely feedback from those who attended helped us decide to make it a regular on long weekends."
<br>

Wondering what the will the vibe be like? James has you covered. “We’re inspired by parties like [Return To Rio](https://ravereviewz.net/interview/ricky-cooper), Glitterbox & Elrow. We want it to be a feel good place where people can come together with an emphasis on fun and good music. So just grab your dancing shoes, throw on something random and prepare to be smothered in all things delightful!'
<br>

Sounds good to us! With more events in the pipeline including a huge October long weekend surprise, make sure you get involved this Sunday to find out what the story is with Morning Glory!
