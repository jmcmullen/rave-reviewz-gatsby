**MUSIC ON MY MIND is back for 2020!**

Over the past two years, we have raised a total of $37,500AUD for mental health charities through our Music on my Mind fundraising raves & online appeals and reached hundreds of thousands of people with our social media posts to raise awareness. 

With the ongoing support of City of Sydney, we will continue raising funds and awareness for mental health in the public and music community this year and would love your support!

**MENTAL HEALTH**

Mental health is a bigger issue now than it ever was. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a massive impact, causing anxiety, stress during lockdown and affecting people financially. 

Pre-covid mental health was already a massive national crisis with 45 percent of Australians experiencing a mental health condition in their lifetime, and approximately 1 million Australian adults with depression and over 2 million with anxiety in any given year.

Rates were even higher in entertainment industry workers, who have 10 times the rate of anxiety, 5 times the rate of depression and double the rate of suicide attempts. The music industry has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic - venues shut down, events and tours cancelled and thousands of jobs lost, which have added to the problem.

In addition to the stresses of the pandemic, the mental health of music industry professionals is at risk from erratic sleep patterns, performance anxiety, hectic touring schedules, easy access to alcohol and drugs, uncertain income and lack of recognition - or for the very successful, the intense scrutiny that comes with fame.

Mental health is an issue close to our hearts at Rave Reviewz, since our founder Dr Kamran Ahmed is a psychiatrist who became aware of the high rates of mental health problems when he started working in the music industry.

The mental health benefits of music are well known; people listen to music to lift their mood, and music therapy is used as part of the treatment for a range of mental illnesses. Music is also a great way to raise awareness of mental health issues, to tackle the stigma that surrounds them and to raise money so charities can continue their great work. 

That's why we launched our music and mental health campaign - ‘MUSIC ON MY MIND’ and we hope you can support the cause!

**MUSIC ON MY MIND 2020**

This year we will be donating 50% of all proceeds raised to [Support Act](https://supportact.org.au/) who help artists and music workers facing hardship due to illness, a mental health problem, injury or some other crisis.

We will be teaming up with some of Sydney's best music crews for our charity rave if covid restrictions allow, otherwise we will be hosting a quality live streamed DJ event! You can expect lots more music related content raising awareness of mental health issues too.

Big thanks to our event partners Ticketswap (ticketswap.com.au), Moshtix, Keep Sydney Open, Electronic music conference, Audio technica and all of Sydney's electronic music community for their support.

Throughout October 2019, we also raised awareness of mental health issues through our music related content. Here's one of our interviews with techno legend Oliver Huntemann:
