**BACKGROUND**

Around 45 percent of people in Australia will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime. In any one year, approximately 1 million Australian adults have depression, and over 2 million have anxiety. Rates are even higher in musicians, who are almost seven times as likely to have thought about suicide in the past 12 months in comparison to the general population, and are twice as likely to attempt to take their own lives.

Some of the factors that contribute to these high rates include erratic sleep patterns, performance anxiety, hectic touring schedules, easy access to alcohol and drugs, uncertain income and lack of recognition - or for the very successful; the intense scrutiny that comes with fame.

Mental health is an issue close to our hearts at Rave Reviewz, since our founder Dr Kamran Ahmed is a psychiatrist who became aware of the high rates of mental health problems in musicians when he started working in the music industry. So we often ask about mental health when we interview DJs, but decided that we should do more.

The mental health benefits of music are well known; people listen to music to regulate their mood, and music therapy is used as part of the treatment for depression, autism, schizophrenia, dementia, agitation, anxiety, sleeplessness, and substance misuse.

Music is also a great way to raise awareness of mental health issues, to tackle the stigma that surrounds them and to raise money so charities can continue their great work. So we’re launching a music and mental health campaign - ‘MUSIC ON MY MIND’.

**FUNDRAISING**

We’ll be raising funds for three mental health charities supporting the public and music community specifically: 

[**Support Act**](https://supportact.org.au/) helps artists and music workers who are facing hardship due to illness, a mental health problem, injury or some other crisis. 

[**beyondblue**](https://www.beyondblue.org.au/) aims to equip everyone in Australia with the knowledge and skills to achieve their best possible mental health, whatever their age and wherever they live. 

[**Black Dog Institute**](https://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/) is dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by depression, bipolar disorder and suicide.
