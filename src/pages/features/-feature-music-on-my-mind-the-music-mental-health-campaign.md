_Music on my Mind is back for 2021!_

Over the past 3 years our music & mental health campaign has raised $40,000AUD for mental health charities through our fundraising raves and reached thousands with our online content to raise awareness of mental health issues.

This year, with support from Way Ahead Music on my Mind is back to improve mental health through music in exciting new ways. Catch all the action on our social media channels throughout October: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/musiconmymind1) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/musiconmy.mind/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MusiconmyMind7)

**MENTAL HEALTH** 

Mental health is a bigger issue now than it ever was. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a massive impact, causing anxiety, stress during lockdown and affecting people financially.

The music industry has been hit particularly hard. It was already a high risk place for mental illness - entertainment workers have 10 x the rate of anxiety, 5 x the rate of depression and 2 x the rate of suicide attempts. Music venues shut down, tours cancelled and jobs lost due to the pandemic have added to this.

Being a psychiatrist, Rave Reviewz founder Dr Kamran Ahmed launched Music on my Mind to improve mental health through music, for fans and industry professionals alike.

Music can lift your mood and reduce stress. Music therapy is used to treat various mental illnesses. Music-related content is also a great way to raise awareness of mental health issues, and music events can raise money for mental health charities to continue their great work. 

So we hope you can support the cause!
