Released on local label Vibe Material, Jamie Gibson aka INVU brings his debut album 'Kickdrum Culture' to life. The Sydney-based producer from Leeds has been crafting his sound in Europe and Australia, quietly amassing a dedicated following while running parties in city hotspots, Candy's Apartment and Sweetheart's Rooftop. 

Moving seamlessly between deep house to tech,the 11-track LP gets going with lead single and laidback percussive roller _Sequence_ followed by _Firefly's_ catchy bassline and tasteful modulation.

INVU's sound is smooth and submerged, characterized by contoured beats and finely tuned drums. He experiments with fragmented vocal samples in deeper tracks like _Motomo_ and _Insert Blank_ and subtle harmonic swells of dancefloor rompers _Look Me_ and _Metropolis_. 

Closing with the one-two combo of Balearic throwback _Eau du 90s_ and analog sizzler _Something Borrowed_, 'Kickdrum Culture' is the perfect soundtrack to Sydney's sun-kissed weather.

We caught up with the main man to ask about the inspiration behind the album and the title...

"I was inspired to produce the album after having a two-year hiatus from music. I was missing it and I decided to launch under a new guise. This new inspiration gave me the drive to set my sights on an album. I wanted to produce a collection of music that represents the many different styles of House/Techno I like. This ranges from deep, tech, acid and minimal. 

The title of my album came from a track I made a long time ago. That track never saw the light of day in the end. However, the name stood the test of time and stuck with me. I feel it perfectly fits the vibe I was going for and encapsulates all the vast and varying genres that make up the House/Techno scene."

What was the creative process behind Metropolis and Something Borrowed? "I just love getting in the studio and letting the creative juices flow. My first go-to is programming the drum and rhythm track. After I have that locked in and recorded it from the drum machine, the search begins for a nice bass patch on my Moog. Once the bottom end is tight and punchy, the main theme of the track is set and the rest comes as I start to arrange the track.

But what made you get into music and tell us some of your career highlights?... "Ever since I was a young child I was infatuated with music and just wanted to get involved somehow," he said. I first started making raps at home when I was 14 and from there, I was drawn towards music production - simply because I wanted original beats to rap to. I pursued DJing at 19 and at that point, there was no turning back... 

My career highlights so far are having my music played on BBC Radio One in the UK, playing at Space in Ibiza for Carl Cox and Miguel Campbell using my vocals on his track “Rockin Beats” on Hot Creations.

Finally, we asked him about his influences. Here's what he had to say: 'The DJ I enjoy the most is Mattias Tanzmann, he always plays exactly what I like. In terms of production, I have always enjoyed music from Ekkohaus, Burnski, Audiojack and Franck Roger. Also, Ray Mono and Carlo Gambino are making some really good stuff at the moment so keep an eye out for them.
