**RR: What was the inspiration behind the album and its name? **

I was inspired to produce the album after having a two-year hiatus from music. I was missing it and I decided to launch under a new guise. This new inspiration gave me the drive to set my sights on an album. I wanted to produce a collection of music that represents the many different styles of House/Techno I like. This ranges from deep, tech, acid and minimal. 

The inspiration for the title of my album came from a track I made a long time ago. That track never saw the light of day in the end. However, the name stood the test of time and stuck with me. I feel it perfectly fits the vibe I was going for and encapsulates all the vast and varying genres that make up the House/Techno scene.



**RR:** **What was the creative process behind Metropolis and Something Borrowed?**

I just love getting in the studio and letting the creative juices flow. My first go-to is programming the drum and rhythm track. After I have that locked in and recorded it from the drum machine, the search begins for a nice bass patch on my Moog. Once the bottom end is tight and punchy, the main theme of the track is set and the rest comes as I start to arrange the track.

**RR: What made you get into music and tell us some of your career highlights? **

Ever since I was a young child I was infatuated with music and just wanted to get involved somehow. I first started making raps at home when I was 14 and from there, I was drawn towards music production - simply because I wanted original beats to rap to. I pursued DJing at 19 and at that point, there was no turning back... 

My career highlights so far are having my music played on BBC Radio One in the UK, playing at Space in Ibiza for Carl Cox and Miguel Campbell using my vocals on his track “Rockin Beats” on Hot Creations.



**RR: Who are your influencers? **

The DJ I enjoy the most is Mattias Tanzmann, he always plays exactly what I like.

In terms of production, I have always enjoyed music from Ekkohaus, Burnski, Audiojack and Franck Roger. 

Also, Ray Mono and Carlo Gambino are making some really good stuff at the moment so keep an eye out for them.
