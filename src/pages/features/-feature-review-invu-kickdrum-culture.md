UK born producer Jamie Gibson aka INVU has quietly amassed a dedicated following since migrating to Australia, while running parties at local hotspots Candy's Apartment and Sweetheart's Rooftop.  We've always got our ear to the streets for new music from Sydney-based talent, so were excited to hear that he  recently released his debut album _'Kickdrum Culture'_ on local label, Vibe Material.

"Ever since I was a young child I was infatuated with music and just wanted to get involved somehow," he told us. "I first started making raps at home when I was 14 and from there I was drawn towards music production, simply because I wanted original beats to rap to. I pursued DJing at 19 and from that point there was no turning back."

Jamie spent years honing his skills in Europe - highlights include his tracks being played on BBC Radio One, performing at Space Ibiza for Carl Cox and Miguel Campbell using his vocals on the Hot Creations track, 'Rockin Beats'. But the launch of this album marks a major milestone is his career, one that has been a long time coming...

"I was inspired to produce the album after having a two-year hiatus from music. I was missing it and I decided to launch under a new guise which gave me the drive to set my sights on an album. I wanted to produce a collection of music that represents the many different styles of House & Techno I like from deep, tech and acid to minimal. That's why I called it _Kickdrum Culture_... it encapsulates the many genres that make up the House & Techno spectrum."

The varied styles on the 11-track LP are evident, but the tracks flow seamlessly from deep house to techier sounds. As a producer, INVU's sound is smooth and submerged; characterized by well-crafted beats, percussive detail and finely tuned drums that make for an immersive experience bound to put a smile on your face. 

Of course, we quizzed him on the creative process behind his tracks - "my first go-to is programming the drum and rhythm track. After I have that locked in and recorded from the drum machine, the search begins for a nice bass patch on my Moog. Once the bottom end is tight and punchy, the main theme of the track is set and the rest comes as I start to arrange the track," he explained.

The album gets going with the laidback percussive roller _Sequence_, followed by Firefly with its infectious bassline. Invu experiments with fragmented vocal samples and beefier beats on tracks like _Motomo_ and _Insert Blank,_ then balances these with the subtle harmonies of dancefloor rompers like _Look Me_ and our fave, _Metropolis_. 

You can definitely hear nods to his self-confessed influences like Mattias Tanzmann, Ekkohaus, and Franck Roger on the album, which draws to a close with the one-two combo of warm Balearic throwback _Eau du 90s_ (bringing out those nostalgic feels) and analog sizzler _Something Borrowed._
