Annie Bass set the scene for an evening of quality music as she warmed up the crowd with mellow house jams and upbeat hits, ranging from Crackazat’s What You’re Feeling to Alyss’ Tsier.

The atmosphere was electric as the sprawling orchestra took position, and the crowd erupted when Pete Tong walked on stage and in his familiar voice, invited us along on a journey through electronic music history.

With Pete steering the time machine from a platform high above the orchestra and Jules Buckley conducting, they immediately launched in to a monster rendition of Fatboy Slim’s Right Here Right Now which had everyone on their feet.

The stunning lighting added to the euphoria as the ensemble recreated hit after hit, from Erick Prydz’s Pjanoo, to The Shapeshifters’ Lola’s Theme, to ATB’s 9pm (till I come).

A number of vocalists lent a hand along the way, including Sneaky Sound System’s Connie Mitchell who added her golden touch to Alison Limerick’s Where Love Lives, and Thandi Pheonix who took us on a brief jaunt in to the modern era as she danced her way through Jax Jones’ You Don’t Know Me.
But the highlight of the night was the extended version of Faithless’ Insomnia – or ‘the longest ever breakdown by a string section’ as Tong put it, which worked the crowd in to a frenzy with its pulsing melodies and pounding beats.

As proceedings drew to a close, Pete thanked the Heritage Orchestra and the deeply satisfied audience, before Connie Mitchell returned to the stage for a final, victorious cover of Candi Staton’s anthem You got the Love.

The audience paid tribute with a well-earned standing ovation - acknowledging a breathtaking show, filled with energy and nostalgia.
