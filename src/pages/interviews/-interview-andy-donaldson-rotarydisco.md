_Garnering praise for their intimate groove sessions, [Rotarydisco](https://www.facebook.com/RotarydiscoSydney/) have the disco/house sound locked down. We dropped in on co-founder Andy Donaldson for a chat..._

**RR:** **Andy - let’s talk about your upcoming NYD extravaganza. Rotary disco have teamed up with **[**Return to Rio**](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interviews/interview/ricky-cooper/)** and Blueprint to bring us a massive lineup. How did it all come together? **

**Andy:** Ricky Cooper from Return to Rio and I are good friends.  We were at a birthday lunch a couple of months back and I was chatting to him about some of the Rotarydisco plans that we were cooking up for a new year’s day party.  He liked the idea, and in particular he loved the venue, so he came on-board and it become a joint venture.  He then suggested [Ben Nott](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interview/ben-nott-blueprint) from Blueprint... and bingo!  The 3 crews came together.  The nice thing about the dance music scene here in Sydney is it's very much a big extended community. 

**RR:** **Each of the brands is hosting an area. What do you think the differences will be in the vibe and music between the 3? **

**Andy:** All 3 brands are a bit different musically.  Rotarydisco is obviously more focused on disco, indie dance/nu-disco and house, Rio is more dreamy progressive and deep house,  Blueprint leans a bit more tech/deep house... though it's a blurry boundary!  The vibe on all 3 levels will be “up for it party”, full of lovely friendly people from all over the world and all walks of life.

**RR:** **Since it’s conception in 2015, Rotarydisco has gone from strength to strength. Which of your parties stands out for you the most?** 

**Andy:** Crikey!  That's a hard one.  Two spring to mind, both of them this year.  Back in January we did a double header with Ron Basejam and Dr Packer at The Port in Darling Harbour - that was awesome, and in September Eli Escobar headlined for us on the roof terrace of Cruise Bar.  Eli had been on our hit list for a long time, so finally getting him locked in was really exciting.  There was a golden moment at that party when he was playing fairly up tempo house and I managed to knock the power out - killed the whole sound system!  We got it back on in a few mins and he used it as an opportunity to change the groove and dropped into Chaka Khan - Ain't Nobody.  The place erupted!  I get shivers down my spine just thinking about it.

**RR:** **Sounds epic! And if you could have any DJ play a Rotarydisco event, who would it be?**  

**Andy:** Oh god, how do I answer that!  Too many to choose from... I'm such a big fan of Eli Escobar I'd have him back again in a heartbeat.  Outside of that I'd choose someone that's snuffed it as it can obviously never happen! ... Let's go with Ron Hardy. 

**RR:** **Great choice. Now you’ve been spinning tunes since the early 90s in London. How did your career in music start? **

**Andy:** Music has always been central to my life.  I started paying musical instruments from an early age and I went to a music school as a youngster in London where I grew up.  In many ways, and like many other poms my age, I'm a child of the acid house/rave explosion that happened in the UK in the late 80s and early 90s.  I was caught up on the wave of electronic dance music that swept the country, got some decks, spent all my money on records... and here we are many years later.

**RR:** **We’ve heard you’ve got a mighty record collection. Which would you pick as your favourite?** 

**Andy:** Impossible to answer!  But I will say this... I LOVE Stevie Wonder, and his album Fulfillingness' First Finale had a massive impact on me when I first heard it.  I was about 8 years old and listening to it was like a musical epiphany.  It changed my life.    

**RR:** **Can you tell us about your time with Pulse Radio and how you got involved?** 

**Andy:** In my other life I work in business and technology.  I joined Pulse to work on the ticket product primarily, helping them to work with their software developers and refine and extend their ticketing platform.  I left earlier this year as I had a few other opportunities I wanted to explore. It was an awesome place to work though.  Wade and Simon that run Pulse are top fellas and the whole Pulse/Finely Tuned/Lost Paradise team are lovely.  I miss them!

**RR:** **Ok, now of all the sets you’ve played, which one has been your favourite?** 

**Andy:** No idea! The best one I've ever played was probably some time in the 90's in London and I can remember next to nothing of that time. Ha!  

**RR:** **We really liked the track you released under the deep house/nu disco moniker, The Garden project. Can we expect more releases from you?** 

**Andy:** You found that did you?  Haha!  That was myself and my lovely friend and Rotarydisco co-founder Tony Garcia having a tinker around in the studio.  Hence the name - Garcia Donaldson - Gar/Don - Garden.  Hopefully I'll get more pieces of music finished soon.  I have the world's largest collection of half finished tracks.  Somewhere in the region of 50 billion... but with 2 kids and busy working life I find it hard to get quality studio time locked in.  I do have a pretty nice collection of synths and analogue bits and bobs though.

**RR:** Finally, what’s your new year’s resolution gonna be??

**Andy:** Spend more time in the studio!

**RR:** Get the kids involved! Haha. Have a great Christmas mate.
