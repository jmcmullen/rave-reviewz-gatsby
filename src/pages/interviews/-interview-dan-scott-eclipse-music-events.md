Since joining forces in 2015, Dan Bayton and Scott Rotton have brought a multitude of memorable parties to Sydney. We sat down with the co-founders of [Eclipse Music Events](https://www.facebook.com/eclipsemusiceventsaus/), as they prepare for a big night on Saturday...

**RR:** Hey guys - you’re hosting an absolute titan this weekend at Manning Bar - [James Zabiela](https://www.facebook.com/jameszabiela/)! What kind of set do you think he will deliver?

**Dan:** Thanks for having us. Yeah it's the big one this weekend and we can't wait! James is such a versatile act which is what makes him so interesting. We can expect to hear a lot of techno mixed with some electronica, and no doubt he will slip a trademark DnB rhythm in there. It's also about the visual aspect of James' set - his energy on stage is mesmerising.

**RR:** OK, let's go back to the beginning - how did you start Eclipse Music Events?

**Dan:** Eclipse initially started in Auckland 4 years ago. Back then the scene over the water wasn't very strong but I managed to find a few small spots that played house & techno. I started chatting to people and became friends with a guy called Ciaran, a fellow DJ from Ireland, and we got Eclipse off the ground. When my visa ran out, I arrived in Sydney and caught up with Scott, my long time mate from my hometown in the UK over a few beers and we decided to start Eclipse in Sydney. Fast forward just over 2 years and here we are!

**RR:** And how would you describe the vibe at a typical Eclipse party?

**Scott:** Our vibe is more towards the deep tech to techno sound... deep bass grooves with nice melodies to keep the dance floor moving makes us happy. I produce techno and I'm more swayed by that sound where as Dan moves more to the house side of the scene. It works great when we play B2B at different parties because we have options and experience in both.

**RR:** One of your biggest ongoing parties is the Sea and Sax cruise - what was the concept behind it?

**Dan:** We absolutely love the Sea & Sax parties! The entire concept is all about the house and the "Ibiza vibe". We introduced a live bongo recently, which was unbelievable. Our first Sea & Sax party with a tiny 90 capacity boat was one of the best days of my life so we thought we would do another. It sold out in 45 minutes so we booked a boat 3 times the size which also sold out. We now have 13 sold out Harbour Cruises with 100% record - we can’t believe it! Our next one is yet to be released but don't worry... it's all booked in and we won't let you down!

**RR:** We were big followers of your weekly [Kompression sessions](https://www.facebook.com/kompressionsessions/), where you'd showcase local talent - will the show be returning anytime soon?

**Scott:** Thank you! Unfortunately the venue needed the space so we had to stop. The great thing about Kompression Sessions was although we used our Eclipse brand it wasn't about us - it was about Sydney DJs, no matter how prolific they were. We had Sydney legend [Robbie Lowe](https://www.facebook.com/robbielowemusic/) but we also had DJs that had never had a gig in Sydney. Kompression Sessions is currently turning into Eclipse TV in which I will be giving tutorials, music/tech news and non-biased reviews on various types of equipment. Watch this space haha!

**RR:** Sounds wicked! Now you guys have thrown many events with big DJs - which has been the most memorable?

**Dan:** It has to be our first international, [Max Chapman](https://www.facebook.com/Chapman.Max/). It was our 2nd Birthday and it was an after party to Sea & Sax with both events selling out. He is such a down to earth bloke and we had a great connection with him. We would have him back in a heartbeat. Guti is a close 2nd though - he was out of this world.

**RR:** We’ve seen you guys play some mad sets - which would you say has been the most memorable?

**Scott:** There's been so many. [Rio](https://www.facebook.com/ReturnToRio/), [Space](https://www.facebook.com/SpaceIbizainAustralia/)... but one in particular was when we warmed up for [Pig&Dan](https://www.facebook.com/piganddan/). I grew up respecting and admiring their productions way before I ever starting DJing, so warming up for them was a surreal feeling. The crowd were amazing all night.

**Dan:** For me, without a doubt, it has to be our first Return to Rio 2 years ago. We played the shack after [Nick Reverse](https://www.facebook.com/nickreverse/)... we play a very similar sound - the place was pumping. We came on and dropped a track from [OC & Verde](https://www.facebook.com/ocandverde/) and everyone went crazy! We had a lot of compliments for weeks after and I felt famous for a bit! Thanks [Ricky](https://www.facebook.com/richard.cooper.5249) hahaha.

**RR:** If you could have anyone headline an Eclipse party, who would it be and why?

**Scott:** Tough one. We have been after [Alan Fitzpatrick](https://www.facebook.com/officialalanfitzpatrick/) for quite some time so I think when we land him eventually it would be a very nice feeling.

**Dan:** So this weekend is very special for me and this is going to sound cliché but James is my number one. I have followed him from the start and there's not many as good as him. We do have a list of acts we are after but it's locked in a secret box, away from other sneaky promoters hahaha.

**RR:** Haha, fair enough. Tell us one track you like to play that always goes off.

**Scott:** [Cirez D – Glow](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Ftrack%2Fglow-original-mix%2F1072359&h=ATMabtB-Nvq320c-2v2jtBv8Ro34G48FT_rZsYxrVMhmTcduMtrETX1csvIYk0zYuNILN_87dmC5Lv6qAXX7SSiUPqfY34LJ6GJDNnNvVdRaH25hM1hh2ns8) is one of my all time favorites and a track I play to death haha.

**Dan:** [Junior Jack - Thrill me](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Ftrack%2Fthrill-me-original-version%2F248304&h=ATMBEUoUQWIpyjomaiAhkzF7SZHHfm9XsB0-Z61_xd2JPHD_B8TaUenlEG3T0x3LrAowaogMdXaZn1_WxXvB4mnkWZYt_RUr0Mi8mp6sZX2zdsYKdFMQn2PB)! It never ever lets me down.

**RR:** Finally - what's up next for Eclipse Events?

**Scott:** February is a big one. As soon as Zabiela is out the way, we are releasing another event with an international headliner and 14 local legends. We can't tell you who it is but he fits our sound perfectly and it's at The Bridge Hotel in Rozelle for a mammoth 15 hour session after [Tell No Tales](https://www.facebook.com/tellnotalesau/). February 24th - save the date!

**RR:** Saved! See you guys on Saturday.
