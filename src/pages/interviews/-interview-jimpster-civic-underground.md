_With 2 successful labels and a stellar discography to his name, Jamie Odell AKA Jimpster remains one of the hardest working artists on today's dance scene. Here's our chat with the man of multiple talents before Saturday's [Social Bewegung](https://www.ravereviewz.net/Promoter/social-bewegung/98) event._
<br><br>

**RR: Jamie, great to chat. We're looking forward to the weekend's gig at the Civic. What can we expect from you on the night?**

Jamie: Hi! I’m really looking forward to this trip to Australia, as it’s my first time in five years and I've loved playing the [Civic Underground](https://www.ravereviewz.net/Venue/Civic-Underground/35) on my previous visits. The venue is great and I hear there’s a new sound system as well as some visuals being installed for this event - so all in all it’s sure to be a special night. You can expect to hear plenty of new and unreleased Freerange and Delusions material as well as some deep, dubby disco, raw house and maybe a few classics for good measure.
<br><br>

**RR: For the last month, your track 'Burning up' has been a prominent fixture on our playlist at [Rave Reviewz](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net) HQ. What was the concept behind it?**

Jamie: Burning Up was inspired by a sound I made on the Korg Minilogue synth which forms the main bass line. It was one of those tracks which came together very quickly and only consists of a few key elements. I jammed out the bassline and then tweaked the sound in one live take, keeping everything as raw and stripped back as possible for maximum impact on the dance floor. I guess you could say it’s one of them more ‘full on’ Jimpster tracks and was great fun to make after having been working on more mellow and deep tracks for a while. It’s certainly been dropping nicely in my DJ sets and great to see a different bunch of DJ’s picking up on it like Kolsch, Tensnake and &Me.
<br><br>

**RR: You've released a lot of great music under your alter egos, Franc Spangler and Audiomontage. How are they different to Jimpster? Any plans to release more tracks under those monikers?**

Jamie: The original idea was that Jimpster would be the moniker for my more eclectic, jazzy, downtempo jams and Audiomontage would be a more dance floor focused alias. But after a few releases under both names, Jimpster started to gain the most attention and so I started getting remix requests as Jimpster which would often be aimed at DJ’s and then things kind of turned on their head a bit. When we started Delusions Of Grandeur we didn’t announce that it was linked to Freerange so I started Franc Spangler as an outlet for the more disco-influenced sounds that we were pushing on it. I’ve not done any Audiomontage material for a while now but will continue to release as Franc Spangler on Delusions and I'm about to start work on a new EP as soon as I finish my latest Jimpster release.
<br><br>

**RR: Nice! You co-founded two very successful labels - [Freerange Records](https://www.facebook.com/FreerangeRecords/) and [Delusions of Grandeur.](https://www.facebook.com/Delusions-of-Grandeur-337255673024451/) What have been the biggest challenges along the way in those journeys?**

Jamie: Many many challenges! Probably the biggest being distribution companies going bust on us on more than one occasion. This would have put most labels out of business but we managed to weather the storm - by managing things carefully and not putting all our (Freerange) eggs in one basket we stayed afloat. It’s sometimes hard to keep things fresh and relevant after 23 years but we keep our ear to the ground and work hard to dig for new, upcoming artists as well as introducing more established names via remixes... so we like to think we still know which direction things are heading in and keep trying to push forward without bandwagon-jumping.

**RR: Now, rumour has it that you've done somewhere in the region of 100 remixes! Talk us through your creative and technical process when remixing a track.**

Jamie: First off, when I’m offered a remix, I listen carefully to the original and make sure I have some specific ideas of how I can bring my own sound and make my interpretation with the sounds and ideas at my disposal. I usually prefer to remix a vocal track, even if my version ends up being a more instrumental or dubby take on it. I have a good idea of the direction I’m going to take even before I load any sounds up so I’ll set out to create what I’m hearing in my head, chopping up original parts, replacing the drums and jamming out a new arrangement. Sometimes a remix comes together very quickly, like three or four days, but usually I spend at least a couple of weeks on something.
<br><br>

**RR: Speaking of remixes - we liked your take on Mystified for Defected. You've done a fair few tracks with the label over the years, can you tell us about your relationship with them?**

<iframe src="https://embed.beatport.com/?id=9234306&type=track" width="100%" height="162" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="max-width:600px;"></iframe>

Jamie: Glad you like the Mystified remix! This was one that came together really quickly actually. Yeah, I’ve done several remixes for Defected over the years and have a lot of respect for how they operate. I know Luke Solomon from Classic who A&Rs the label quite well and he’s a good guy and has a great ear for what works in the clubs from his years of experience as a DJ and producer. If he thinks that a certain project might be suitable for a Jimpster remix, the chances are he’ll be right. They’ve also invited me to play a few of their parties and I had a great time with them in Croatia for their Defected event at the Garden Tisno the last two years.
<br><br>

**RR: You've broken some serious new artists, including Detroit Swindle, Tornado Wallace and Session Victim. Are there any young producers who have caught your eye at the moment?**

Jamie: There’s a lot of amazing emerging talent in house music at the moment. Some of the guys I’m checking out include [Massiande](https://soundcloud.com/freerangerecords/sets/massiande-yesterday-today-forever-ep) from Chile, [Austin Ato](https://www.facebook.com/austinatouk/) from Scotland, [Bawrut](https://www.facebook.com/Bawrut/) from Spain and [Sam Irl](https://www.facebook.com/samirlmusic/) from Austria. 
<br><br>

**RR: And having been in the game for 2 decades, what advice would you give to DJs or producers starting out?**

Jamie: Try to find your own sound and niche. There are millions of producers out there so it’s important to work out what you offer that is different from the next one. This applies to both production and DJing and is fairly obvious, but I think these days many people see DJing and production as a way to earn a living, as opposed to coming into it through a passion for music. Sometimes it seems people are just copying whatever the latest big sound is to try and get the same level of success and often the lack of authenticity can be heard instantly.

**RR: Now, if we asked you to pick a favourite set from across your extensive career, which one springs to mind?**

Jamie: I tend not to record or listen back to my DJ sets as the atmosphere of the room doesn’t always transfer to the recording but [this gig in San Diego](https://soundcloud.com/musicis4lovers/jimpster-live-at-lovelife) was a great boat party, super busy, and they also had a mic in the crowd so you get a bit of feeling for the vibe.
<br><br>

**RR: Finally - what else have you got coming up this year? Any releases or projects we can look forward to?**

Jamie: I’ve just finished a new Jimpster EP which has three original tracks plus a Bawrut remix of Burning Up.  Also look out for my Jimpster Remixes 2008-2017 compilation which will be dropping on Freerange in September. I remixed the Bawrut track More Cowbell which will be out in June on Ransom Note and there will also be a remix I made of Charles Webster’s Webster Wraight Ensemble coming after summer.

**RR: Great stuff Jamie. See you on Saturday!**
