_If there’s a name that’s synonymous with Australian’s dance music scene, it would have to be [Robbie Lowe](https://www.facebook.com/robbielowemusic/). Rave Reviewz' Sean McDonald caught up with the eclectic DJ about his illustrious career after his set at Enter the Beehive; part of the Meet me in Darlo event._

**RR: Robbie, great set. Enter The Beehive and [Meet Me in Darlo](https://www.facebook.com/events/292009331276595/) have been a lot of fun, how involved have you been with the Keep Sydney Open movement?**

Robbie: I hold the flag up high for the cause – it’s in my best interests and I want to see the culture stay strong in Sydney. You’ll always find me on the frontline.

**RR: You’ve been DJing in Sydney a long time and must have seen a lot of change. How do you feel about the current state of the industry, particularly since the Lockout laws took effect?**

Robbie: There’s no denying the lockout laws dealt a heavy blow to the industry. SPICE was my dream gig and I had residency there at the time of the lockouts, which eventually shut it down. It was a real blow because our business model was based on after hours – it turned a lot of livelihoods, whether a DJ, club, restaurant owner, etc, upside-down. But out of this huge negative came a lot of positives. It’s brought everyone closer together and created a new scene, a sort of revolution; right now, I think Sydney has never been so vibrant. There are parties everywhere, including after-hours parties again and it has set us all on a different course. The government are also starting to loosen their grip and will continue to. Nothing can stop the music!

**RR: Absolutely! You’re a big part of the [By Your Side](https://www.facebook.com/ByYourSideSydney/) team, who represent many emerging DJs and producers. Do you get involved with mentoring these new talents as they navigate through the industry?**

Robbie: I do! Once upon a time I was a budding DJ and Paul ‘Flex’ Taylor saw me and passed on his wisdom – I like to help the aspiring DJ's I see with passion and potential by offering advice and doing the same. By Your Side’s director, [Jimmy Galvin](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interview/jimmy-galvin-by-your-side) is a very good friend of mine and his heart is in the right place. He throws parties from the heart and is doing it all for the right reasons.

**RR: As a veteran DJ, you’ve enjoyed many late nights and travelled around the world; do you have any tips for young DJs on their well-being and enduring a long career?**

Robbie: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. I’m a keen surfer – it keeps me grounded and I love being in the ocean. Surfing looks after my body and after all these years, I feel my career is still going strong. I won’t stop DJing anytime soon and I haven’t peaked. I think it’s important to look after yourself as you can burn out really quickly.

**RR: Sound advice. You’ve shared the decks and warmed up for many international superstars – is there a particular gig that stands out for you?**

Robbie: I did some great warmups for [Digweed](https://www.facebook.com/djjohndigweed/) – one at Home in 2006 and a Greenwood gig 5 years ago. I also did Tiesto warmups at the Hordern Pavilion for a crowd of 6000 people which was amazing. But the standout would have to be my 8 hour set at Spice which actually went down a week before the lockout laws. The gig was to celebrate 20 years of DJing and from start to finish I had the crowd. [James Zabiela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBJmAl0BeXg) rocked up during it and tapped me on the shoulder to ask if we could play B2B which was humbling as he is one of my favourite DJs – he didn’t realise I was on a mission to play an 8 hour set. Any other night I would have said yes!

**RR: Haha, sounds epic. Is there a DJ you haven’t supported yet but would love to?**

Robbie: I’m very lucky to have played alongside all my progressive house favourites – Sasha, Digweed, Howells, Dave Seaman, [Cattaneo](https://www.facebook.com/hernancattaneo/), Kleinenberg… there are some techno DJs I like but I think there are other DJs that champion that sound that would do a better job. 

**RR: Fair enough. What can we look forward to from you in the future? Any projects in the pipeline that you can reveal?**

Robbie: I’m playing at the [Global Underground](https://www.facebook.com/events/1563659050364245) gig at the Greenwood Nov 4, which is a real honour because Global Underground is close to my heart. I’m also doing main stage sets at [Electric Gardens](https://www.facebook.com/electricgardensfestival/) and Subsonic – can’t wait for those!

**RR: You mentioned your love for surfing and all of us at [Rave Reviewz](https://www.ravereviewz.net/) enjoy your hilarious cooking adventures on Instagram. Is there anything outside of DJing you would like to pursue in the future?**

Robbie: Well, I’ve worked for everything I’ve got and I can’t say I’ve taken life too seriously – I just try and have a good time. I never had mega aspirations, I just do what I love and strive to be the best I can be. I always believed I was born to be in the entertainment industry somehow. Maybe one day I could open a restaurant/bar, DJ and be like Rocky Balboa when he runs his restaurant telling old DJ stories! Right now, I love nothing better than mixing tracks and making people dance. 

**RR: And you sure do make them dance. Thanks Robbie.**
