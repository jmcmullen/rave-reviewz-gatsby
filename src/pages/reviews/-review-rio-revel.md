Following the success of _The Hangout stage_ at Electric Gardens Festival last month, [Return to Rio](https://www.facebook.com/ReturnToRio/) were back with a fresh instalment on their party roster - **The Rio Revel**. With their signature dÃ©cor and high quality production, the team transformed the Manning Bar into an eye-catching playground, fit for its line-up of local & international powerhouse DJs.

Getting the party started in the main room were the [Motif](https://www.facebook.com/MOTIFSYDNEY/) boys - [Jesse Pepper Kooraram](https://www.facebook.com/jesse.kooraram) and [Stuart Hunter](https://www.facebook.com/stuart.hunter.397), in fine form as the numbers filtered through the door. Meanwhile, outside in the courtyard was Hernanâ€™s specially-requested warm up DJ [Steve Marx](https://www.facebook.com/DJSteveMarx), working the crowd with a tasty deep set.

The Rio vibe was in full effect - a super-friendly crowd of like-minded revellers, loving the music and basking in sun; some in the colourful festival gear, glitter and face paint typical of Rio, others sporting Argentinian football shirts with Cattaneo across the back.

A cheer signalled the arrival of the main man [Hernan Cattaneo](https://www.facebook.com/hernancattaneo/) to the decks, who started with slow and long transitions captivating the audience, then switched the tempo delivering an onslaught of rich progressive melodies and basslines. His 5 hour marathon set featured seamlessly textured tracks from the likes of [Einmusik](https://www.facebook.com/einmusik/), [Dmitry Molosh](https://www.facebook.com/dmitrymoloshofficial/) and [Danny Howells](https://www.facebook.com/dannyhowellsdj/), with every drop triggering a roar from the crowd and an exchange of nods and high-fives between strangers across the dance floor.

As minutes turned to hours and day turned to night, the biggest surprise came in the form of co-headliner [Guy Mantzur](https://www.facebook.com/GuyMantzur.official/), joining Hernan for an impromptu B2B in the final hour. The energy between them was palpable and indicative of two close friends in musical synergy - a fitting end to Hernanâ€™s high calibre prog set.

Next up, [Andy Ef](https://www.facebook.com/theandyef/) and Rio boss [Ricky Cooper](https://www.facebook.com/richard.cooper.5249) dropped infectious beats in the courtyard before passing the baton to special guest and [Burning Man](https://www.facebook.com/burningman/) regular, [Tara Brooks](https://www.facebook.com/tarabrooksofficial/). Countering the unexpected rain with her arsenal of tracks, Brooks demonstrated the technical skills that caught the eyes and ears of veterans like [John Digweed](https://www.facebook.com/djjohndigweed/).

Indoors, Guy Mantzur had taken over from rising prog star [Zankee Gulati](https://www.facebook.com/ZankeeGulati) in the main room. Flanked by visual screens, strobe lightning and a room full of pumping fists, the scene was set for a good old fashioned rave. [PlattenBank](https://www.facebook.com/PlattenBankRecords/) boss Mantzur went on to conduct an energising mixture of tech-house and progressive grooves, including [Khen](https://www.facebook.com/khenmusicofficial/)â€™s show-stopping _â€˜[Children with no name](https://www.beatport.com/track/children-with-no-name-feat-kamila-original-mix/8320238)â€™_ and his own collaboration with Roy Rosenfold, _â€˜[Epika](https://www.beatport.com/track/epika-original-mix/6424849)â€™_.

As the 11 hour day fest drew to a close, the revellers dispersed satisfied and the Rio crew had delivered the goods with all the hallmarks of their brand - quality music, good vibes and attention to detail. A strong contender for the best party of the season.
